Welcome to ExpenseBalance

Karen and I split living expenses, and this is an easy way to keep track.

It's built for couples who need to track who's "ahead" and who's "behind". Currently it only supports one couple per app, but I hope to expand it later.

The app is built on Rails 3 and jQuery mobile, and uses Devise for authentication. All templates are written in HAML.
